# PCL-GUI
A PCL GUI for fun and practice

My goal with this project is to create a simple GUI for the Point Cloud Library (PCL) using the Qt framework.
Where this project goes will depend on my free time and interest over time.
All source images were taken using Intel's realsense R200 depth camera.
